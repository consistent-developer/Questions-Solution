    <p class="text-FiraCode Question QuestionNumber">
      Define: algorithm, flowchart, compiler
    </p>
    <!-- Answer 1 : a -->
    <p class="Answer ">
      <span class="u">Algorithem</span> : an algorithm is a procedure for solving problems. In order to solve a
      mathematical or computer problem,this is the first step in the process. <br><br>

      <span class="u">Flowchart</span> : A flowchart is the graphical or pictorial representation of an algorithm with
      the
      help of different symbols, shapes, and arrows to demonstrate a process or a program. With algorithms, we can
      easily
      understand a program. The main purpose of using a flowchart is to analyze different methods. <br><br>

      <span class="u">Compiler</span> : A compiler translates the code written in one language to some other language
      without changing the meaning of the program. It is also expected that a compiler should make the target code
      efficient and optimized in terms of time and space.

    <p class="QuestionNumber">Question 1 : ( b )</p>
    <!-- Question 1 : b -->
    <p class="text-FiraCode Question ">
      Why null value is used in string? Justify your answer with example
    </p>

    <!-- Answer 1 : b -->
    <p class="Answer ">
      The reason null terminator on string is because once it is broken down into assembly language each
      character gets a byte of sequential logical memory allocated to it in the stack in the main memory (RAM) and that
      is
      what the computer looks for to know 2 things. <br><br>

      The length of the string to find available memory.
      To know where the end of the string is otherwise it will continue to read sequentially through memory until it
      finds
      a null terminator. <br><br>
      This means that if you forget a null terminator the pointer indicating that string in memory is going to go into
      the
      next block of memory data that has nothing to do with your string. <br><br>
      So when you declare a constant string like <br><br>

      const char *s = “Hello!”; <br><br>

      A null character ‘\0’ is appended to the end of the string (C does it for you; you don’t need to explicitly add
      it,
      unless you’re working with some kind of a variable string) to let the code that works on your string where the end
      really is. For example, when printf() function is used on a null-terminated string, the characters are printed to
      the standard output until a null character (‘\0’) is encountered. If there was no null-character, the program will
      start to misbehave (probably print out some garbage value).

      List all operators used in C and explain any three with example.

    <p class="text-Nunito Answer ">
      An operator is a symbol that tells the compiler to perform specific mathematical or logical functions. C language
      is rich in built-in operators and provides the following types of operators <br><br>
